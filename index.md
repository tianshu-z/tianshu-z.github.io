<p><strong>April 5, 2021</strong> | New chapter </p>

<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> | I have not been working on my composition experiments at all since I was relocated in China. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, I started to write science articles under the supervision of my uncle. He's great! This is the least I could do to play my part in the society.</p>

<p><strong>May, 2019</strong> | I have weekly updates on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zoe-zhao-676421317/sets/machine-or-i"><i><u>machine-and-i</u></i></a> album using machine learning algorithm to compose. I named it <i><u>machine-or-i</u></i> in the first place, but thought <i><u>machine-and-i</u></i> was more appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>July 29, 2019</strong> | Bye bye, <a href="https://ccam.yale.edu"> Yale Center for Collaborative Arts and Media (CCAM)</a>. See you in the next Chapter.</p>
